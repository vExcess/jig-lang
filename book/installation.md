# Installation

Currently Jig is not production ready and therefore doesn't distribute binaries. You will need to compile Jig yourself and then add the binary to your path

## Add binary to your path
Linux: add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file
```
export PATH="/home/yourUsername/path/to/binary:$PATH"
```

## Verify installation
Open a terminal and run `jig`
